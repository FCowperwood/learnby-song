Ten o'clock postman
Bring me her letter
Ten o'clock postman
Make me feel better
Been so many days
Since that I've met her
Ten o'clock postman
Bring me her letter

I'm walking all over the room
Wonder why I don't stop biting my nails
Why carry this feeling of doom
A couple more hours and I'll get the mail
I'll get the mail
